The goal of our new LinkedMusic Partnership is to link music databases through metadata schemas: structures for organizing information stored in a database. This will go a long way towards bringing online music search to the same level of sophistication currently possible for text-based resources, allowing us to answer fundamental questions about music and how it interacts with human creativity, society, culture, and history. 

Our goals include:

* Develop a comprehensive international metadata schema for music
* Develop mapping tools to map extant metadata schemas onto our new schema
* Index aggregated metadata to enable simultaneous search of individual databases
