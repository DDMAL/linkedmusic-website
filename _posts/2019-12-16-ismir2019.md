Back at the beginning of November, several members of our lab made the journey to the Netherlands to attend and present at [ISMIR2019](https://ismir2019.ewi.tudelft.nl/) and related satellite conferences. (ISMIR was from Nov. 4-8 with satellites before and after). Delft was a really neat city to visit, with as many bicycles, canals, and pounds of black licorice you could ever want...

We will be hosting [ISMIR2020](https://ismir.github.io/ISMIR2020/) here in Montreal so it was also great to see the ever-growing conference in action! (It was my first ISMIR too.)

Satellites before the conference included WoRMS, WiMIR, and the first-ever Workshop on Designing Human-Centric MIR systems. We had presenters at two of these, and a few of our students attended the WiMIR hackathon event as well.

## Workshop on Reading Music Systems (WoRMS) ##

This was the second year for WoRMS -- former SIMSSA postdoc Jorge Calvo-Zaraogoza is one of the chairs. PhD student Tim DeReuse presented work on "Robust Transcript Alignment on Medieval Chant Manuscripts". Check out the full [WoRMS proceedings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lomhWwpO00VHv8zlIKwUHWICvmFQ7sBD/view), including Tim's paper.

## Designing Human-Centric MIR Systems ##

This was the first year of the [Workshop on Designing Human-Centric MIR Systems](https://sites.google.com/view/designinghuman-centricmir/home) Link to the [proceedings](https://sites.google.com/view/designinghuman-centricmir/proceedings. 

SIMSSA Postdoc Finn Upham presented "Human Subtracted: Social Distortion of Music Technology." Check out their [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/upham_2019_hcmir_humansubtracted_slides.pdf) and [extended abstract]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/upham_2019_hcmir_humansubtracted_extabstract.pdf).

## ISMIR ##

ISMIR in Delft was bigger than ever, with over 500 participants. Two students from our lab gave presentations.

Yaolong Ju presented "[An Interactive Workflow for Generating Chord Labels for Homorhythmic Music in Symbolic Formats](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000106.pdf)."

Tim de Reuse presented again, this time on "[Pattern Clustering in Monophonic Music by Learning a Non-Linear Embedding From Human Annotations](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000093.pdf)". He was also the winner for the MIREX "Patterns for Prediction" task.

ISMIR2019 also included tutorials, an unconference, and nine different flavours of water available all day! They set a high bar for 2020 and it was a pleasure to attend.

## Digital Libraries for Musicology (DLfM) ##

After ISMIR, we headed to The Hague for the 6th edition of [Digital Libraries for Musicology](https://dlfm.web.ox.ac.uk/), held at the National Library of the Netherlands. Our lab was well-represented, with four people presenting their research.

Néstor Nápoles López discussed his work on "[Key-Finding Based on a Hidden Markov Model and Key Profiles]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/napoleslopez_2019_dlfm_keyfinding_paper.pdf)", done in collaboration with former SIMSSA postdoc Claire Arthur. Check out the [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/napoleslopez_2019_dlfm_keyfinding_slides.pdf).

Matan Gover presented "A notation-based query language  for searching in symbolic music". Link to [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/gover_2019_dlfm_notation_slides.pdf).
