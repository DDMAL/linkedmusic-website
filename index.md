The goal of our new LinkedMusic Partnership is to link music databases through metadata schemas: structures for organizing information stored in a database. This will go a long way towards bringing online music search to the same level of sophistication currently possible for text-based resources, allowing us to answer fundamental questions about music and how it interacts with human creativity, society, culture, and history. 

Some challenges:
* Music exists in multiple forms: as a visual artifact in scores, written in many different types of notation; as audio recordings (tapes, records, and digital files in multiple formats); and as sound in visual films and music videos.
 
* The author/title/date information that can identify most texts does not work for music, which requires composer, lyricist, arrangers, performers, performances, publisher, record label, etc. 

* While textual metadata (i.e., information about the data) can often be inferred from the text itself, this does not work for music, as contents of music cannot be searched using Google-style text queries. There are hundreds of specialized online music databases that contain valuable metadata and musical content. But because each database uses a different system for organizing the metadata, and uses different formats for musical content, searching across them is a huge challenge, severely limiting their potential use for large-scale music research. There is nothing for music like Google Books or Project Gutenberg.

Some questions that can be addressed:

How do we locate the music of cultural groups whose music was never promoted by the music industry? 
How does the music of a cultural community work to create their identity, and to influence the larger musical culture? 
How does the role of women musicians in a particular period interact with the status of women in that society? 
How does the medium in which music is preserved affect its dissemination? 

Our goals include:

* Develop a comprehensive international metadata schema for music
* Develop mapping tools to map extant metadata schemas onto our new schema
* Index aggregated metadata to enable simultaneous search of individual databases
