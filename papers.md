<p>Canning, Erin, Susan Brown, Sarah Roger, and Kimberley Martin. 2022. “The Power to Structure : Making Meaning from Metadata Through Ontologies.” <em>KULA: Knowledge Creation, Dissemination, and Preservation Studies, Metadata as Knowledge</em>, 6 (3):1–15. https://doi.org/10.18357/kula.169.</p>
<p>&#8226; The Linked Infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship project (LINCS) helps humanities researchers tell stories by using linked open data to convert humanities datasets into organized, interconnected, machine-processable resources. LINCS provides context for online cultural materials, interlinks them, and grounds them in sources to improve web resources for research. This article describes how the LINCS team is using the shared standards of linked data and especially ontologies to bring meaning mindfully to metadata through structure. The LINCS metadata—comprised of linked open data about cultural artifacts, people, and processes—and the structures that support it must represent multiple, diverse ways of knowing. It needs to enable various means of incorporating contextual data and of telling stories with nuance and context, situated and supported by data structures that reflect and make space for specificities and complexities. As it addresses specificity in each research dataset, LINCS is simultaneously working to balance interoperability, as achieved through a level of generalization, with contextual and domain-specific requirements. The LINCS team’s approach to ontology adoption and use centers on intersectionality, multiplicity, and difference. The question of what meaning the structures being used will bring to the data is as important as what meaning is introduced as a result of linking data together, and the project has built this premise into its decision-making and implementation processes. To convey an understanding of categories and classification as contextually embedded—culturally produced, intersecting, and discursive—the LINCS team frames them not as fixed but as grounds for investigation and starting points for understanding. Metadata structures are as important as vocabularies for producing such meaning.</p>

<p>&#8226; The article covers the creation of a metadata schema to promote interoperability and characterize historically collected geoscience data. While not in the same field, the article shows the steps taken to develop a switching-across methodology, as well as an example of the methodology. </p>

<p>Khan, Huda, Claire DeMarco, Christine Fernsebner Eslao, Steven Folsom, Jason Kovari, Simeon Warner, Tim Worrall, and Astrid Usong. 2022. “Using Linked Data Sources to Enhance Catalog Discovery.” <em>KULA: Knowledge Creation, Dissemination, and Preservation Studies, Metadata as Knowledge</em>, 6 (3):1–26. https://doi.org/10.18357/kula.229.</p>

<p>&#8226; This article explores how linked data sources and non-library metadata can support the open-ended discovery of library resources. They also consider which experimental methods are best suited to improving library catalog systems. They provide an overview of the questions driving our discovery experiments with linked data, a summary of their usability findings, and their design and implementation approach. In addition, they situate the discussion of their work within the larger framework of library cataloging and curation practices.</p>

<p>Lisena, Pasquale, Albert Meroño-Peñuela, and Raphaël Troncy. 2022. “MIDI2vec: Learning MIDI Embeddings for Reliable Prediction of Symbolic Music Metadata.” Edited by Mehwish Alam, Davide Buscaldi, Michael Cochez, Francesco Osborne, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Harald Sack, Mehwish Alam, et al. <em>Semantic Web</em> 13 (3):357–77. https://doi.org/10.3233/SW-210446.</p>

<p>&#8226; An important problem in large symbolic music collections is the low availability of high-quality metadata, which is essential for various information retrieval tasks. In this work, the writers propose MIDI2vec, a new approach for representing MIDI ﬁles as vectors based on graph embedding techniques. Their strategy consists of representing the MIDI data as a graph, including the information about tempo, time signature, programs, and notes. Next, they run and optimize node2vec for generating embeddings using random walks in the graph. They demonstrate that the resulting vectors can successfully be employed for predicting the musical genre and other metadata such as the composer, the instrument, or the movement. Their proposal has real-world applications in automated metadata tagging for symbolic music, for example in digital libraries for musicology, datasets for machine learning, and knowledge graph completion.</p>

<p>&#8226; Linked data (LD) have the capability to open up and share materials, held in libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs), in ways that are restricted by many existing metadata standards. Specifically, LD interlinking can be used to enrich data and to improve data discoverability on the Web through interlinking related resources across datasets and institutions. However, there is currently a notable lack of interlinking across leading LD projects in LAMs, impacting the discoverability of their materials. In this article, LAM Linked Data projects and services were reviewed, including the Library of Congress, The German National Library, and the French National Library. Six Linked Data interlinking tools were also reviewed (AgreementMaker, LogMap, LinkItUp, The SILK Link Discovery Framework, The LIMES Link Discovery Framework for Metric Spaces, and the OpenRefine RDF Extension). The research also describes the Novel Authoritative Interlinking for Semantic Web Cataloguing in Libraries (NAISC-L) interlinking framework. Unlike existing interlinking frameworks, NAISC-L was designed specifically with the requirements of the LAM domain in mind. NAISC-L supports the linking of related resources across datasets and institutions, thereby enabling richer and more varied search queries, and can thus be used to improve the discoverability of materials held in LAMs.</p>

<p>&#8226; 
The Jazz Ontology is a semantic model that addresses the challenges the domain of jazz poses due to musical content and performance specificities. The model builds strongly on the Music Ontology and utilizes datasets such as MusicBrainz, the Weimar Jazz Database, and LinkedJazz to build out the Ontology further. Some elements were modified, such as creating a shortcut between the Music Ontology Performance and Signal classes, and bypassing the abstract Sound concept and Recording event. For bands, the model utilizes a relationship to connect the band to its leader and relates Performers to a single Performance to allow for musicians to change on tracks. The ontology has been assessed by examining how well it supports describing and merging existing datasets and whether it facilitates novel discoveries in a music browsing application. The utility of the ontology is also demonstrated in a novel framework for managing jazz-related music information. This involves the population of the Jazz Ontology with the metadata from large-scale audio and bibliographic corpora (the Jazz Encyclopedia and the Jazz Discography). The resulting RDF datasets were merged and linked to existing Linked Open Data resources. These datasets are publicly available and are driving an online application used by jazz researchers and music lovers for the systematic study of jazz.</p>

<p>&#8226; This article reviews the founding, current state, and potential future of VIAF®, the Virtual International Authority File. VIAF consists of an aggregation of bibliographic and authority data from over 50 national agencies and infrastructures, systems that follow different cataloging practices, and contain hundreds of languages. After a short history of the project, the results of surveys for implementers of linked data projects on the use of VIAF data provide suggestions for future use and sustainability.</p>

<p>Topham, Kate, Julian Chambliss, Justin Wigard, and Nicole Huff. 2022. “The Marmaduke Problem: A Case Study of Comics as Linked Open (Meta)Data.” <em>KULA: Knowledge Creation, Dissemination, and Preservation Studies, Metadata as Knowledge</em>, 6 (3):1–8. https://doi.org/10.18357/kula.225.</p>

<p>&#8226; Michigan State University (MSU) is home to one of the largest library comics collections in North America, holding over three hundred thousand print comic book titles and artifacts. Inspired by the interdisciplinary opportunity offered by digital humanities practice, a research collaborative linked to the MSU Library Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) developed a Collections as Data project focused on the Comic Art Collection. This team extracted and cleaned over forty-five thousand MARC records describing comics published in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In order to bridge digital humanities with the popular culture legacy of the institution, the MSU comics community turned to bibliographic metadata as a new way to leverage the collection for scholarly analysis. In October 2020, the Department of English Graphic Possibilities Research Workshop gathered a group of scholars, librarians, Wikidatians, and enthusiasts for a virtual Wikidata edit-a-thon. This project report will present this event as a case study to discuss how linked open metadata may be used to create knowledge and how community knowledge can, in turn, enrich metadata. They explore not only how the participants utilized the open-access tool Mix’n’match to connect the Comic Art Collection dataset to Wikidata and increase awareness of lesser-known authors and regional publishers missing from OCLC and Library of Congress databases, but how the knowledge of this community in turn revealed issues of authority control.</p>

<p>Bianchini, Carlo, Stefano Bargioni, and Camillo Carlo Pellizzari di San Girolamo. 2021. “Beyond VIAF:” <em>Information Technology and Libraries</em> 40 (2):31. https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v40i2.12959.

<p>&#8226; This paper aims to investigate the reciprocal relationship between VIAF® and Wikidata and their possible roles in the semantic web environment. It deals with their data, their approach, their domain, and their stakeholders, with particular attention to identification as a fundamental goal of Universal Bibliographic Control. After examining interrelationships among VIAF, Wikidata, libraries, and other GLAM institutions, a double approach is used to compare VIAF and Wikidata: first, a quantitative analysis of VIAF and Wikidata data on personal entities, presented in eight tables; and second, a qualitative comparison of several general characteristics, such as purpose, scope, organizational and theoretical approach, data harvesting and management (shown in table 9). Quantitative data and qualitative comparison show that VIAF and Wikidata are quite different in their purpose, scope, organizational and theoretical approach, data harvesting, and management. The study highlights the reciprocal role of VIAF and Wikidata and their helpfulness in the worldwide bibliographical context and in the semantic web environment and outlines new perspectives for research and cooperation.</p>
