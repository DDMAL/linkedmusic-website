## The LinkedMusic Project is looking for two post-doc researchers for January 2023! Closing date for both positions is 5 December 2022.

# Musical Metadata

**The Project**
The LinkedMusic Project at McGill University’s Schulich School of Music seeks a postdoctoral researcher with a demonstrable interest and strengths in musical metadata to work on the creation of a metadata schema. This is a one-year position (renewable for up to three years), starting January 2023. 

LinkedMusic is a seven-year research partnership grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, headed by Ichiro Fujinaga, Primary Investigator. The aim of the LinkedMusic Project is to link music databases through metadata schemas: structures for organizing information stored in a database.  The team brings together cutting-edge researchers with the digital musical resources and expertise of partner institutions, including DIAMM, RISM, Cantus Ultimus, Global Jukebox, and MetaBrainz. The goal is a global digital music library that connects all kinds of music data and enables users to make queries across multiple databases. This will go a long way towards bringing online music search to the same level of sophistication currently possible for text-based resources, allowing us to answer fundamental questions about music and how it interacts with human creativity, society, culture, and history. 

Over the course of the project, the research team will develop tools to convert existing metadata schemas into a flexible and extensible format using linked data principles, in addition to creating a virtual instrument museum with linked data content. The postdoctoral researcher will aid in the first phase of the project, the development of a multilingual metadata schema for music and easy-to-use, semi-automatic mapping tools to align existing metadata schemas to the new schema through a Linked Data format.  As part of their work, they will help supervise a research group of graduate and undergraduate student developers and collaborate with a variety of content teams from partner institutions. 

**Preferred Qualifications:**
* PhD (required before start-date) in Information Science, Library Science, Musicology, or related fields 
* Experience with library cataloguing and/or music metadata 
* Experience with Linked Open Data 
* Familiarity with standard metadata schemas of music databases 
* Track record of publications and presentations in relevant fields 
* Track record of supervision of students 
* Work with large, multi-part projects or partnerships 
* Knowledge of multiple languages 
* Strong written and verbal communication skills 

Interested people should apply even if they do not feel that their background is a 100% match with the position description. All candidates will be given full consideration. McGill University is an equal-opportunity employer. 

**Practicalities:**

The salary will be $42,000 CAD per annum with a health and dental plan. The one-year position will begin in January 2023, or as soon as the candidate is available; there is a possibility of a renewal for up to 3 years. The candidate will be full-time (35h/week). Working hours are flexible, with some obligation to participate in scheduled meetings. A shared office space will be provided to the postdoctoral researcher, as well as access to university services.  

**Applications should consist of:**
* A brief cover letter outlining relevant experience
* A resume
* Additional materials (e.g., examples of previous work) are welcome, but not required

* Candidates short-listed for an interview may be asked for two confidential reference letters

Materials should be addressed to Ichiro Fujinaga, but sent to Anna de Bakker,  Research Associate, at anna.de.bakker@mcgill.ca with the subject line: LinkedMusic Postdoctoral Researcher: Metadata. 

# Virtual Instrument Museum

**The Project**
The LinkedMusic Project at McGill University’s Schulich School of Music seeks a postdoctoral researcher with experience in web development to work on the Virtual Instrument Museum. This is a one-year position (renewable for up to three years), starting January 2023.

LinkedMusic is a seven-year research partnership grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, headed by Ichiro Fujinaga, Primary Investigator. The aim of the LinkedMusic Project is to link music databases through metadata schemas: structures for organizing information stored in a database.

This will go a long way towards bringing online music search to the same level of sophistication currently possible for text-based resources, allowing us to answer fundamental questions about music and how it interacts with human creativity, society, culture, and history. 

Over the course of the project, the research team will develop tools to convert existing metadata schemas into a flexible and extensible format using linked data principles, in addition to creating a virtual instrument museum with linked data content. The postdoctoral researcher will help develop a unique, crowd-sourced musical instrument picture dictionary, the Virtual Instrument Museum (VIM), which will include pictures and videos of instruments and their names in different locations and local languages, and develop the necessary tools to map them to a Uniform Resource Identifier. This website will help expand vocabularies for linked data in music and improve online queries involving instruments. The postdoctoral researcher will also help supervise a research group of graduate and undergraduate student developers and collaborate with a variety of content teams. 

**Preferred Qualifications:**
* PhD (required before start-date) in Information Science, Library Science, Computer Science, Musicology, or related fields  
* Experience with designing and/or managing websites and databases 
* Expert knowledge of Javascript and/or web development 
* Knowledge of organology and instruments of different cultures and/or periods 
* Experience with scholarly crowdsourcing 
* Experience with library cataloguing and/or music metadata 
* Familiarity with Linked Open Data 
* Track record of publications and presentations in relevant fields 
* Track record of supervision of students 
* Work with large, multi-part projects or partnerships 
* Knowledge of multiple languages 
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
