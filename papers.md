<p>Canning, Erin, Susan Brown, Sarah Roger, and Kimberley Martin. 2022. “The Power to Structure : Making Meaning from Metadata Through Ontologies.” <em>KULA: Knowledge Creation, Dissemination, and Preservation Studies, Metadata as Knowledge</em>, 6 (3):1–15. https://doi.org/10.18357/kula.169.</p>
<p>&#8226; The Linked Infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship project (LINCS) helps humanities researchers tell stories by using linked open data to convert humanities datasets into organized, interconnected, machine-processable resources. LINCS provides context for online cultural materials, interlinks them, and grounds them in sources to improve web resources for research. This article describes how the LINCS team is using the shared standards of linked data and especially ontologies to bring meaning mindfully to metadata through structure. The LINCS metadata—comprised of linked open data about cultural artifacts, people, and processes—and the structures that support it must represent multiple, diverse ways of knowing. It needs to enable various means of incorporating contextual data and of telling stories with nuance and context, situated and supported by data structures that reflect and make space for specificities and complexities. As it addresses specificity in each research dataset, LINCS is simultaneously working to balance interoperability, as achieved through a level of generalization, with contextual and domain-specific requirements. The LINCS team’s approach to ontology adoption and use centers on intersectionality, multiplicity, and difference. The question of what meaning the structures being used will bring to the data is as important as what meaning is introduced as a result of linking data together, and the project has built this premise into its decision-making and implementation processes. To convey an understanding of categories and classification as contextually embedded—culturally produced, intersecting, and discursive—the LINCS team frames them not as fixed but as grounds for investigation and starting points for understanding. Metadata structures are as important as vocabularies for producing such meaning.</p>

<p>&#8226; The article covers the creation of a metadata schema to promote interoperability and characterize historically collected geoscience data. While not in the same field, the article shows the steps taken to develop a switching-across methodology, as well as an example of the methodology. </p>

<p>Khan, Huda, Claire DeMarco, Christine Fernsebner Eslao, Steven Folsom, Jason Kovari, Simeon Warner, Tim Worrall, and Astrid Usong. 2022. “Using Linked Data Sources to Enhance Catalog Discovery.” <em>KULA: Knowledge Creation, Dissemination, and Preservation Studies, Metadata as Knowledge</em>, 6 (3):1–26. https://doi.org/10.18357/kula.229.</p>

<p>&#8226; This article explores how linked data sources and non-library metadata can support the open-ended discovery of library resources. They also consider which experimental methods are best suited to improving library catalog systems. They provide an overview of the questions driving our discovery experiments with linked data, a summary of their usability findings, and their design and implementation approach. In addition, they situate the discussion of their work within the larger framework of library cataloging and curation practices.</p>

<p>Lisena, Pasquale, Albert Meroño-Peñuela, and Raphaël Troncy. 2022. “MIDI2vec: Learning MIDI Embeddings for Reliable Prediction of Symbolic Music Metadata.” Edited by Mehwish Alam, Davide Buscaldi, Michael Cochez, Francesco Osborne, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Harald Sack, Mehwish Alam, et al. <em>Semantic Web</em> 13 (3):357–77. https://doi.org/10.3233/SW-210446.</p>

<p>&#8226; An important problem in large symbolic music collections is the low availability of high-quality metadata, which is essential for various information retrieval tasks. In this work, the writers propose MIDI2vec, a new approach for representing MIDI ﬁles as vectors based on graph embedding techniques. Their strategy consists of representing the MIDI data as a graph, including the information about tempo, time signature, programs, and notes. Next, they run and optimize node2vec for generating embeddings using random walks in the graph. They demonstrate that the resulting vectors can successfully be employed for predicting the musical genre and other metadata such as the composer, the instrument, or the movement. Their proposal has real-world applications in automated metadata tagging for symbolic music, for example in digital libraries for musicology, datasets for machine learning, and knowledge graph completion.</p>


<p>McKenna, Lucy, Christophe Debruyne, and Declan O’Sullivan. 2022. “Using Linked Data to Create Provenance-Rich Metadata Interlinks: The Design and Evaluation of the NAISC-L Interlinking Framework for Libraries, Archives and Museums.” <em>AI & SOCIETY</em>, January, 27. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01373-z.</p>

<p>&#8226; Linked data (LD) have the capability to open up and share materials, held in libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs), in ways that are restricted by many existing metadata standards. Specifically, LD interlinking can be used to enrich data and to improve data discoverability on the Web through interlinking related resources across datasets and institutions. However, there is currently a notable lack of interlinking across leading LD projects in LAMs, impacting the discoverability of their materials. In this article, LAM Linked Data projects and services were reviewed, including the Library of Congress, The German National Library, and the French National Library. Six Linked Data interlinking tools were also reviewed (AgreementMaker, LogMap, LinkItUp, The SILK Link Discovery Framework, The LIMES Link Discovery Framework for Metric Spaces, and the OpenRefine RDF Extension). The research also describes the Novel Authoritative Interlinking for Semantic Web Cataloguing in Libraries (NAISC-L) interlinking framework. Unlike existing interlinking frameworks, NAISC-L was designed specifically with the requirements of the LAM domain in mind. NAISC-L supports the linking of related resources across datasets and institutions, thereby enabling richer and more varied search queries, and can thus be used to improve the discoverability of materials held in LAMs.</p>

<p>&#8226; 
The Jazz Ontology is a semantic model that addresses the challenges the domain of jazz poses due to musical content and performance specificities. The model builds strongly on the Music Ontology and utilizes datasets such as MusicBrainz, the Weimar Jazz Database, and LinkedJazz to build out the Ontology further. Some elements were modified, such as creating a shortcut between the Music Ontology Performance and Signal classes, and bypassing the abstract Sound concept and Recording event. For bands, the model utilizes a relationship to connect the band to its leader and relates Performers to a single Performance to allow for musicians to change on tracks. The ontology has been assessed by examining how well it supports describing and merging existing datasets and whether it facilitates novel discoveries in a music browsing application. The utility of the ontology is also demonstrated in a novel framework for managing jazz-related music information. This involves the population of the Jazz Ontology with the metadata from large-scale audio and bibliographic corpora (the Jazz Encyclopedia and the Jazz Discography). The resulting RDF datasets were merged and linked to existing Linked Open Data resources. These datasets are publicly available and are driving an online application used by jazz researchers and music lovers for the systematic study of jazz.</p>

<p>&#8226; This article reviews the founding, current state, and potential future of VIAF®, the Virtual International Authority File. VIAF consists of an aggregation of bibliographic and authority data from over 50 national agencies and infrastructures, systems that follow different cataloging practices, and contain hundreds of languages. After a short history of the project, the results of surveys for implementers of linked data projects on the use of VIAF data provide suggestions for future use and sustainability.</p>

<p>Topham, Kate, Julian Chambliss, Justin Wigard, and Nicole Huff. 2022. “The Marmaduke Problem: A Case Study of Comics as Linked Open (Meta)Data.” <em>KULA: Knowledge Creation, Dissemination, and Preservation Studies, Metadata as Knowledge</em>, 6 (3):1–8. https://doi.org/10.18357/kula.225.</p>

<p>&#8226; Michigan State University (MSU) is home to one of the largest library comics collections in North America, holding over three hundred thousand print comic book titles and artifacts. Inspired by the interdisciplinary opportunity offered by digital humanities practice, a research collaborative linked to the MSU Library Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) developed a Collections as Data project focused on the Comic Art Collection. This team extracted and cleaned over forty-five thousand MARC records describing comics published in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In order to bridge digital humanities with the popular culture legacy of the institution, the MSU comics community turned to bibliographic metadata as a new way to leverage the collection for scholarly analysis. In October 2020, the Department of English Graphic Possibilities Research Workshop gathered a group of scholars, librarians, Wikidatians, and enthusiasts for a virtual Wikidata edit-a-thon. This project report will present this event as a case study to discuss how linked open metadata may be used to create knowledge and how community knowledge can, in turn, enrich metadata. They explore not only how the participants utilized the open-access tool Mix’n’match to connect the Comic Art Collection dataset to Wikidata and increase awareness of lesser-known authors and regional publishers missing from OCLC and Library of Congress databases, but how the knowledge of this community in turn revealed issues of authority control.</p>

<p>Aljalahmah, Saleh H., and Oksana L. Zavalina. 2021. “Information Representation and Knowledge Organization in Cultural Heritage Institutions in Arabian Gulf: A Comparative Case Study.” <em>Journal of Information & Knowledge Management</em> 20 (4):24. https://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219649221500507.</p>

<p>&#8226; This paper presents the exploratory study conducted with the goal of developing an understanding of the current state of information representation and knowledge organization in cultural heritage collections in Arabian Gulf countries and perspectives for future developments. This comparative case study focused on three institutions (an archive, an academic library, and a museum), including early adopters and leaders in digital archiving in the region. The mixed-methods research combined semi-structured interviews with in-depth comparative content analysis of metadata records that represent items in institutions' collections. Despite the limitations of the small-sample analysis, this exploratory case study makes a substantial contribution to research and practice. It is the first study to evaluate information representation and knowledge organization practices in cultural heritage collections of Arabian Gulf countries. This study also can inform the planning and implementation of the large-scale study of the state and perspectives of information representation and knowledge organization across digital and physical collections of libraries, museums, and archives in the region. Suggestions for future research are included. Practical implications of the study include empirical support for the need for metadata training, development and documenting metadata creation guidelines and crosswalks, and collection and use of feedback from users and knowledge management professionals to improve information representation and knowledge organization. Results also provide insights into the interoperability potential of metadata for future regional, national, and international aggregations of cultural heritage digital collections across the Arabian Gulf region.</p>

<p>Bianchini, Carlo, Stefano Bargioni, and Camillo Carlo Pellizzari di San Girolamo. 2021. “Beyond VIAF:” <em>Information Technology and Libraries</em> 40 (2):31. https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v40i2.12959.
</p>

<p>&#8226; This paper aims to investigate the reciprocal relationship between VIAF® and Wikidata and their possible roles in the semantic web environment. It deals with their data, their approach, their domain, and their stakeholders, with particular attention to identification as a fundamental goal of Universal Bibliographic Control. After examining interrelationships among VIAF, Wikidata, libraries, and other GLAM institutions, a double approach is used to compare VIAF and Wikidata: first, a quantitative analysis of VIAF and Wikidata data on personal entities, presented in eight tables; and second, a qualitative comparison of several general characteristics, such as purpose, scope, organizational and theoretical approach, data harvesting and management (shown in table 9). Quantitative data and qualitative comparison show that VIAF and Wikidata are quite different in their purpose, scope, organizational and theoretical approach, data harvesting, and management. The study highlights the reciprocal role of VIAF and Wikidata and their helpfulness in the worldwide bibliographical context and in the semantic web environment and outlines new perspectives for research and cooperation.</p>

<p>&#8226; Due to COVID-19, many GLAM institutions saw an increase in materials going online. The University of South Florida Libraries utilized Linked Data technology to provide easy access to digital cultural heritage collections not only for the scholarly communities but also for underrepresented user groups. The paper covers the challenges of putting information online, discusses Linked Data and the solutions it can provide, and propose future work to further the effort. </p>

<p>Bonora, Paolo, and Angelo Pompilio. 2021. “Corago in LOD : The debut of an Opera repository into the Linked Data arena.” <em>Jlist.it</em>. EUM-Edizioni Università di Macerata, 54–72. https://doi.org/10.4403/jlis.it-12699.</p>

<p>&#8226; The paper examines the adoption of the Semantic Web (SW) technologies and Linked Data (LD) principles to manage a knowledge base about opera.  The Corago repository collects historical data and documentation about opera works, performances, and librettos from the 16th to the 20th  century. The writers experimented with the use of semantic technologies to manage the repository's knowledge cataloged following the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) relational model. Cultural Heritage  Knowledge Bases (CHKB) as Corago could leverage SW and LD to overcome proprietary models and to introduce new information to better satisfy users' requirements.</p>

<p>Dagher, Iman, and Denise Soufi. 2021. “Authority Control of Arabic Personal Names: RDA and Beyond.” <em>Cataloging & Classification Quarterly</em> 59 (2–3):260–80. https://doi.org/10.1080/01639374.2020.1845896.</p>

<p>&#8226; This paper discusses the basics of creating name authority records for Arabic personal names in accordance with Resource Description and Access instructions and Program for Cooperative Cataloging guidelines. A background into the use of romanization for non-Latin scripts in bibliographic and authority records is provided to establish the context. Issues with romanization that are particular to Arabic are addressed. Separate sections on modern and classical names provide an overview of the major challenges, and strategies to enhance discovery are outlined. The paper concludes with an examination of the possible benefits of identity management and other changes in the authority control landscape for names in non-Latin script.</p>

<p>Fafalios, Pavlos, Kostas Petrakis, Georgios Samaritakis, Korina Doerr, Athina Kritsotaki, Yannis Tzitzikas, and Martin Doerr. 2021. “FAST CAT: Collaborative Data Entry and Curation for Semantic Interoperability in Digital Humanities.” <em>Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage</em> 14 (4):1–20. https://doi.org/10.1145/3461460.</p>

<p>&#8226; FAST CAT is a web-based collaborative software system for assistive data entry and curation in Digital Humanities and other forms of empirical research. The program was approached with semantic interoperability in mind, which allows for data to be exchanged with unambiguous, shared meaning. The paper details the functionality and user interface offered by FAST CAT. The paper showcases a use case via the SeaLiT project, which examines the economic, social, and demographic impacts of the introduction of steamboats in the Mediterranean area between the 1850s and the 1920s. </p>

<p>Faraj, Ghazal, and András Micsik. 2021. “Representing and Validating Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graphs in CIDOC-CRM Ontology.” <em>Future Internet</em> 13 (11). Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute:277. https://doi.org/10.3390/fi13110277.</p>

<p>&#8226; In order to unify access to multiple heterogeneous sources of cultural heritage data, many datasets were mapped to the CIDOC-CRM ontology. CIDOC-CRM provides a formal structure and definitions for most cultural heritage concepts and their relationships. The COURAGE project includes historic data concerning people, organizations, cultural heritage collections, and collection items covering the period between 1950 and 1990. Therefore, CIDOC-CRM seemed the optimal choice for describing COURAGE entities, improving knowledge sharing, and facilitating the COURAGE dataset unification with other datasets. This paper introduces the results of translating the COURAGE dataset to CIDOC-CRM semantically. This mapping was implemented automatically according to predefined mapping rules. Several SPARQL queries were applied to validate the migration process manually. In addition, multiple SHACL shapes were conducted to validate the data and mapping models.</p>

<p>Filtz, Erwin, Sabrina Kirrane, and Axel Polleres. 2021. “The Linked Legal Data Landscape: Linking Legal Data across Different Countries.” <em>Artificial Intelligence and Law</em> 29 (4):485–539. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-021-09282-8.</p>

<p>&#8226; The European Union is working toward harmonizing legislation across Europe, in order to improve the cross-border interchange of legal information. This goal is supported for instance via standards such as the European Law Identiﬁer (ELI) and the European Case Law Identiﬁer (ECLI), which provide technical speciﬁcations for Web identiﬁers and suggestions for vocabularies to be used to describe metadata pertaining to legal documents in a machine-readable format. Notably, these ECLI and ELI metadata standards adhere to the RDF data format which forms the basis of Linked Data and therefore has the potential to form a basis for a pan-European legal Knowledge Graph. Unfortunately, to date said speciﬁcations have only been partially adopted by EU member states. In this paper, we describe a methodology to transform the existing legal information system used in Austria into such a legal knowledge graph covering different steps from modeling national speciﬁc aspects to population, and ﬁnally the integration of legal data from other countries through linked data. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by exemplifying practical use cases from legal information searches, which are not possible in an automated fashion so far.</p>

<p>&#8226; Presented by the LIBER Linked Open Data (LOD) Working Group, this report looks at publishing LOD from a library perspective and argues why it should be employed and how. They present various aspects of the topic, introduce different options available, and lay out a foundation for possible exploration at a later stage. As such, the body of this document presents the six steps of LOD publication and explains each one of these steps in depth.</p>

<p>Gal, Avigdor, Haggai Roitman, and Roee Shraga. 2021. “Learning to Rerank Schema Matches.” <Em>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</Em> 33 (8):3104–16. https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2019.2962124.</p>

<p>&#8226; Schema matching is at the heart of integrating structured and semi-structured data with applications in data warehousing, data analysis recommendations, Web table matching, etc. Schema matching is known as an uncertain process and a standard method to overcome this uncertainty introduces a human expert with a ranked list of possible schema matches to choose from, known as top-K matching. In this work, the writers propose a learning algorithm that utilizes an innovative set of features to rerank a list of schema matches and improve upon ranking the best match. They provide a bound on the size of an initial match list, tying the number of matches with the desired level of confidence in finding the best match. They also propose the use of matching predictors as features in a learning task and tailored nine new matching predictors for this purpose. The proposed algorithm assists the matching process by introducing a quality set of alternative matches to a human expert. It also serves as a step towards eliminating the involvement of human experts as decision makers in a matching process altogether. A large-scale empirical evaluation with a real-world benchmark shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic solution.</p>

<p>Green, Ashlea M. 2021. “Metadata Application Profiles in U. S. Academic Libraries: A Document Analysis.” <em>Journal of Library Metadata</em> 21 (3–4). Routledge:105–43. https://doi.org/10.1080/19386389.2022.2030172.</p>

<p>&#8226; This paper describes a document analysis of 24 metadata application profiles (MAPs) used by academic libraries in the United States. The MAPs under study were collected from (a) the DLF AIG Metadata Application Profile Clearinghouse and (b) a Google search of .edu domains. Data collection and analysis took place between December 2020 and February 2021. While most of the MAPs under review provided metadata guidelines for digital collections, a small number were intended for institutional repositories or research data management. The study’s findings reveal MAP features and content, usage of controlled vocabularies and standards, and other characteristics pertaining to MAP document scope, contents, and format in this context. In addition to its discussion of the literature, the paper’s findings should help metadata specialists and others involved in digital collection management gain insights useful in the development or revision of their own metadata documentation. Further, these findings offer a current glimpse of metadata application practices among U.S. academic libraries generally.</p>

<p>Kalogeros, Eleftherios, Matthew Damigos, Michalis Sfakakis, Sofia Zapounidou, Aggeliki Drakopoulou, Costas Zervopoulos, Gerasimos Martinis, Christos Papatheodorou, and Manolis Gergatsoulis. 2021. “Digitizing, Transcribing and Publishing the Handwritten Music Score Archives of Ionian Islands Philharmonic Bands.” In <em>Metadata and Semantic Research</em>, 1537:388–99. Communications in Computer and Information Science. Cham: Springer International Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98876-0.</p>

<p>&#8226; During the long history of the philharmonic bands in the Ionian Islands, valuable archives of handwritten music scores have been established. These archives consist of the scores of original works locally created and adaptations of western music works of Greek and other European composers. For the long-term preservation of the archives of 7 Philharmonic Bands, the handwritten music scores were digitized and a significant amount of them was transcribed into MusicXML. Moreover, all these archives were integrated into and published as a single archive. All these activities were part of the project “Preservation and Prominence of the Musical Heritage of the Region of Ionian Islands Prefecture through the management of the digital archives of the Philharmonic Orchestras of the Region.” This work presents the challenges, the workflows, and the system developed to achieve the objectives of the project.</p>

<p>Kern, Christopher Julian, Thomas Schäffer, and Dirk Stelzer. 2021. “Towards Augmenting Metadata Management by Machine Learning.” <em>INFORMATIK 2021</em>, 10. https://dx.doi.org/10.18420/informatik2021-121.</p>

<p>&#8226; Managing metadata is an important section of master data management. It is a complex, comprehensive, and labor-intensive task. This paper explores whether and how metadata management can be augmented by machine learning. The writers deduce requirements for managing metadata from the literature and from expert interviews. They also identify features of machine learning algorithms. They assess 15 machine learning algorithms to determine their contribution to meeting the requirements and the extent to which they can support metadata management. Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, as well as neural networks, have the greatest potential to support metadata management effectively. Reinforcement learning, however, does not seem to be well suited to augment metadata management. Using Support Vector Machines and the identification of metadata as an example, we show how machine learning algorithms can support metadata management.</p>

<p>Khan, Fahad, and Ana Salgado. 2021. “Modelling Lexicographic Resources Using CIDOC-CRM, FRBRoo and Ontolex-Lemon.” In <em>Proceedings of the International Joint Workshop on Semantic Web and Ontology Design for Cultural Heritage Co-Located with the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge 2021</em>, 12. Bolzano, Italy. https://dblp.org/db/conf/swodch/swodch2021.html#KhanS21.</p>

<p>&#8226; The article describes a new approach to the modeling and publication of lexicographic resources, including retro-digitized dictionaries, as linked data. This approach is based on the use of the CIDOC-CRM aligned FRBRoo ontology together with the Ontolex-Lemon vocabulary and its follow-up lexicographic module, lexicog. After introducing the TEI-based distinction between diﬀerent views on lexicographic resources, the writers discuss Ontolex-Lemon and CIDOC-CRM, and FRBRoo. Next, they look at some motivating use cases before introducing our approach. Finally, they model one of these use cases in more depth using this approach.</p>

<p>Megdiche, Imen, Franck Ravat, and Yan Zhao. 2021. “Metadata Management on Data Processing in Data Lakes.” In <em>SOFSEM 2021: Theory and Practice of Computer Science, 12607:559–68. Lecture Notes in Computer Science</em>. Bolzano-Bozen, Italy: Springer International Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-67731-2.</p>

<p>&#8226; Data Lake (DL) is known as a Big Data analysis solution. A data lake stores not only data but also the processes that were carried out on these data. It is commonly agreed that data preparation/transformation takes most of the data analyst’s time. To improve the efficiency of data processing in a DL, the writers propose a framework that includes a metadata model and algebraic transformation operations. The metadata model ensures the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data processes as well as data lineage of processes. Moreover, each process is described through a set of coarse-grained data trans forming operations which can be applied to different types of datasets. They illustrate and validate our proposal with a real medical use case implementation.</p>
