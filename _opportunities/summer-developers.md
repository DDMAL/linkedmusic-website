The Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project is hiring McGill undergraduate and graduate students to work as summer software developers.

Candidates should have a solid background in Python or JavaScript. Enrolment in a Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Music Technology degree is preferred, but not required. Ability to read music notation is considered a strong asset.

One of the developers will be hired to work on [jSymbolic](http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_jSymbolic.html), which will require Java experience and music theory knowledge. Please emphasize these skills if you have them.

The position goes from 29 April to 30 August 2019\. The work week will be 35 hours, with ten days unpaid holiday to be taken at any point after the initial two-week training period. The hourly rate ranges from $15.50-24.50 depending on year at McGill (First-year Undergrad through late PhD), plus a percentage on top of hourly rate for vacation and statutory holiday indemnities. This is taxable employment income.

To apply, please email the following documents to SIMSSA Project Manager Emily Hopkins (emily.hopkins@mcgill.ca) by midnight **10 March 2019**:

* your CV
* your GitHub account (preferred) or a recent code example
* a letter of intent
* your unofficial transcript (you can take a screenshot from Minerva and send us that)
