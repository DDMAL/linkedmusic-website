## Five Tasks


1. Create a metadata schema 

2. Adapt existing conversion tools to publish metadata from other music databases 

3. Adapt a metadata mapping tool 

4. Build the metasearch engine

5. Build a picture dictionary (pictionary) of musical instruments 

## Twelve Databases

* [RISM](https://rism.info/): Répertoire International des Sources Musicale (International Inventory of Musical Sources is a collaborative international catalogue that began in 1952 and went online in 2015. It provides a comprehensive collection of bibliographic citations and abstracts of writings on music, providing one of the most important resources for the global music research community. It contains records of over 200,000 music prints and over a million music manuscripts in 214 languages from 151 countries.

* [DIAMM](https://www.diamm.ac.uk/): Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music is the world’s largest online collection of digital images of medieval European polyphonic music manuscripts (about 4,000). The free website includes detailed information for almost all of the known manuscript sources.

The [Metabrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/) is a non-profit organization “that believes in free, open access to data.” They will provide four databases:
* [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) contains metadata about artists, releases, labels, and the relationships between them (1.5M artists, 2M releases, and 21M recordings).
* [AcousticBrainz](https://acousticbrainz.org/) contains acoustic features and information for 4.3M unique recordings.
* [CritiqueBrainz](https://critiquebrainz.org/) is a repository for music reviews (10,000 reviews, 1,400 users).
* [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/) is an open-source website where users upload their listening history (318M listens).

We will also be working closely with three SSHRC-funded projects, each of which involves one or more databases:

[SIMSSA](https://simssa.ca/): “Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis” (2014–21), PI: Ichiro Fujinaga
* [Cantus Ultimus](cantus.simssa.ca) is a fully searchable interface for plainchant manuscripts hosted by University of Waterloo.
* [SIMSSA DB](db.simssa.ca) is a database of files containing searchable symbolic representations of scores.

MML16: “Mapping the Musical Landscape of the Sixteenth Century” (2019–24), PI: Julie Cumming 
* MML16 DB will be a database of inventories of 16th-century music manuscripts and prints.

[DACT](http://dact-chant.ca/): “Digital Analysis of Chant Transmission” (2019–22), PI: Jennifer Bain
* [Cantus Database](cantus.waterloo.ca) is a database of inventories of Latin plainchant manuscripts.
* [Cantus Index](cantusindex.org) is a collection of 12 different national databases of plainchant manuscripts. 
* Canadian Chant Database will be a database of plainchant manuscripts and prints in Canada.
